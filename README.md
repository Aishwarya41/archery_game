# archery_game
This is an archery game made using python and guizero. 
The project uses model-view separation method in order to separate the interface from the implementation.

archery.py is the model/implementation.
archery_gui.py is the view/interface.
archery_test contains tests for the basic functionality of the archer model.
helpers.py implements helper functions.

The other files/images are used in the code for the game.

The player drags a line on the screen and shoots the arrow to get points. The number of points depends on the accuracy of the hit.

The player can view the leaderboard for the top 5 best scores.

This code can be used to add new features to the game or modify current ones!
